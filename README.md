# SFDX_DynamicTerritoryManager
Dynamic Territory Manager is a powerful Salesforce-native solution that allows admins to build, assign, and visualize territories dynamically based on User roles, profiles, geolocation, and business rules using Custom Metadata, Apex, and LWC.
This project is perfect for companies that donâ€™t use Salesforce Enterprise Territory Management (ETM) or want a more customizable and extendable solution.
